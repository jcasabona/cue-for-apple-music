/**
 * Thin, defensive wrapper around the macOS Music app's AppleScript dictionary.
 *
 * Three things shape this file:
 *
 *  1. **Failures are reported, never swallowed.** An earlier version resolved `undefined` on
 *     error and discarded stderr, which made a broken status read look exactly like "Music
 *     says everything is off" -- every button worked, every reading was wrong, and nothing in
 *     the log said why. Errors are now logged once per distinct message.
 *
 *  2. **Music is never launched to read it.** Whether Music is running is decided in Node
 *     with `pgrep`, not in AppleScript. Entering a `tell application "Music"` block starts the
 *     app, and asking AppleScript the question instead means compiling app terminology on
 *     every poll -- which is itself a source of failure when the app is closed.
 *
 *  3. **On macOS 26+, `current track` raises -1728** for Apple Music catalogue tracks,
 *     autoplayed tracks, and anything played from the Home, Radio or Recently Added tabs.
 *     Every property is read in its own `try`, and an unreadable field comes back empty --
 *     which is deliberately *not* the same as "off". Conflating those two is what made the
 *     toggles one-way and the volume dial snap to zero.
